# NFT Minting

This code serves as a foundational example illustrating the process of minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in Cadence on the Flow blockchain. It can be employed as a launching point for the development of your customized NFTs on the Flow network.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Cadence. The contract allows you to mint NFTs.First it creates a collection in the account address given by the owner.Then it takes the input from the user like address,user name,lucky number,fav food etc. and it mints an NFT.
 

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need the following:

1)A Flow account with sufficient FLOW tokens to pay for the transaction fees

2)The Flow CLI tool installed on your machine

3)A code editor or IDE for modifying the code
## Usage

To use this code to mint your own NFTs on the Flow blockchain, follow these steps:

1)Clone this repository to your local machine.

2)Open the nft-mint.cdc file in your code editor or IDE.

3)Modify the metadata dictionary to include the metadata for your NFTs, such as the name, description, and image URL.

4)Modify the mintNFT function to specify the total number of NFTs you want to mint and the price of each NFT.

5)Save the nft-mint.cdc file.

6)Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.

7)Run the following command to deploy the contract to the Flow blockchain:
flow project deploy

8)Once the contract is deployed, run the following command to mint your NFTs:
flow transactions send ./transactions/mintNFT.cdc

9)Enter your Flow account credentials when prompted.

10)Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Flow blockchain.
